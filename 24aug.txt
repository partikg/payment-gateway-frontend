quantity:
if product already is in cart and again add the same product to cart then its quantity should get increased 
for this in addtocart function,in else condition 
lets runs a map loop to update the values in the data 
and in that loop if condition as v.id is equal to payload.id which  means my product is alrady saved in cart and i again saved in cart then it does into the else conditon where i loop all the data in the cart so the data in cart ie v.id and the data i just added into cart has their id already in the cart 
so id of the data in loop and the id of the data in cart are same then add one more value to the quantity 
when my whole loop is finished running
then set it into the localstorage 
so we add product into the cart then again for already added product in cart we select it again so its quality becomes 2 


plus or minus quantity:
on clicking plus button the quantity of product should get increase and on clicking minus button the quantity of product should get decreased 
for this get the same code from else condition of map and localstorage
in updatecartqty function, and paste it over here 
in cart page, at plus and minus code, change the function in dispatch as updatecartaddqty(value.id) and updatecartminusqty(value.id) with only passing id 
also import updatecartaddqty and updatecartminusqty 
then in cartsices page,change updatecartqty function and make two function as updatecartaddqty() and updatecartminusqty() 
also export both of them 
so in updatecartaddqty function, we have the code as adding the quantity and in if condition only pass action.payload 
but in updatecartminusqty function, we have make changes as in if condition apply another if condition that v.qty is greater than 1 then minus the quantity
now if we click on plus button the product gets added and on clicking minus button the product gets removed 




checkout:
on clicking checkout button we want to do payment 
like we click on checkout button then a razorpay popup comes in which we fill information and payment is done 
for razorpay we need to get its package 
we have to work in both react and nodejs
in nodejs we need to make two apis of placorder and confirm-order api 
placeorder api means in razorpay an order is placed and which gives an order id which would be useful in react 
confirm-order api means i have done the razorpayment or not 
now bydefault we will have placeorder as 1 means pending status 
then in react we will complete the payment process which on success and unsuccessful payment gives response 
if my payment is success or even unsuccessful then we will call confirm-order api where we will send order id from placeorder api
and also send status to confirm my order 

now on razorpay website we will use test mode for no real payment 
where we will get information about payment received or failed 

we have to install packages in node and react 
go to razorpay npm website for node and reactrazorpay website for react and install their packages  
also having backend code(for node project) and frontend code(for react project) 


backend:
open nodejs project ie API project, go to server.js file in which we have called a order routes url 
in order routes file, we make two url of place-order(before razorpay payment call place-order api which generate order id) and confirm-order(after completing razorpay payment to ensure payment confirmed and show in backend which payment are sucess or failed)
in orders controller file,we have two functions placeorder and confirmorder 
in order file,make schema for information you want to save like user_id,products_details,order_total,
razorpay_order_id(before payment we get the order id which we save here),
razorpay_payment_id(after payment we get payment id),
status(1 to 7 values with each one having different meaning like 1 is for order placed,2 is for complete,3 is for failed),
shipping_detail,
also include timestamps as true which would automatically generate two keys in the database as created_at and updated_at 

now from razorpay npm website,copy the basic usage code and paste in orders controller file 
give key_id and key_secret 
then in placeorder function, we have database of user_id,products_details,order_total,shipping_detail,status 
after data is saved go to then condition,
where we have amount(my orders total value),currency(INR),receipt(id) in options variable
we get this code from razorpay npm websites order code 
then instance.orders.create() function,
where we pass these options(amount,currency,receipt) and it is async
in this we use await as we update order in database so data variable will save in database where our order is generated then the razorpay_order_id will not go as razorpay_order_id will go when we will make order in payment gatemway 
so we in instance creating order where instance is from the razorpay key_id and key_secret code 
so in instance.order.create we create order where we pass the information from data variable(having user_id,products_details,order_total,shipping_detail,status)
then await ordermodel.updateOne() so we use updateOne function for the data saved as we get razorpay_order_id from razorpay account this razorpay_order_id we will pass to the  razorpay_order_id key 
we have passed async function(err,order) for error and success 
so on order placed successfully we pass order 
now in thunderclient,make a place-order api and in formencoded give input as user_id as 1,products_details as [] (ie null object as we get input from frontend),order_total as 100,shipping_detail as []
and send where we get response from payment gateway in which we get id 
so in mongodb we get the record with this id 
also we have razorpay_payment_id so we call this placeorder api in frontend where we will get this razorpay_payment_id which we would save in this id 


for confirmorder function,
when we call api from frontend then we will send id and status
now same code as in await ordermodel.updateOne() function code 
just change id as razorpay_order_id and pass as request.body.order_id then we would update razorpay_payment_id and status 
so our backend is done 




for frontend:
from react razorpay npm website, install the package for frontend react or nodejs project  

In cart page, at checkout code call placeorder function 
then we make a placeorder function and openpaymentpopup function 
in that get the code from npm react-razorpay website, 
so from basic example code copy the import code paste it in here 

in cart page,in placeorder function, 
set shippingdetails object like address
then userid in which pass login users id
then make a productdetails constant in which all cart items are passed in loop and in that make a array in which product id,qty,price,total amount is saved 
then run api place-order api in which pass user_id,products_details,order_total,shipping_detail
now this place-order api response will have placeorder function response from the  instance.orders.create() function response which were send in data to use it again 
so in then function, when we get response from api then in if condition success.data.data.status 
as to get data we need to write success.data as alwayls then the next data is get from the api and status is key which we get in the data(in thunderclient response)
so if status key is found in the thunderclient response then open payment popup function in which we pass id (from thunderclient response) and the whole object(all response from thunderclient response)
and esle shows in console unsuccessful to place order 

after this openpaymentpopup function,
after clicking on checkout button a payment gateway popup will open 
in openpaymentpopup function pass order id and razorpayorder 
then get the code from npm react-razorpay website basic example
so the popup page will have options object having 
key consist of razorpay id,
amount in which pass razorpayorder.amount*100 as money is passed in paise so multiply it by 100,
currency as INR,
name for razorpay payment gateway,
description,image for razorpay payment gateway logo,
order_id as razorpay_order_id as we got in thunderclient response,
then handler function as when your payment is successfull it goes to handler function 
then prefill object having name,email,contact value 
then theme for giving color in popup page 

then rzp1 function in which if your payment is unsuccessful it goes in this function 
and this code also we get in react-razorpay npm websites basic example code

so when we click on checkout button it opens the razorpay payment gateway popup 

when we click on card option then it asks card details in which we dont enter real card detail but use razorpay dummy card number websites card number 
then give any expiry,name,cvv value 
then click pay now before selecting success and failure 
go to razorpay dashboard where we can see our payment as created 
then click success now it shows authorized 

now update this sucess or failed payment in database 
for this in openpaymentpopup functions, in handler function,
first console log response which give response in console after clicking success button and completing payment 
in console we get razorpay_order_id and razorpay_payment_id
then give confirm-order api having parameters as order_id,payment_id,status as 2(2 for complete)
in order_id pass resonse.razorpay_order_id from which we get in  console 
and in payment_id pass resonse.razorpay_payment_id from which we get in  console 

copy this axios api code and paste in rzp1 function
give status as 3(3 for failed)


completing payment:
so now in mongodb we have lastest record as with status 1 
then click on checkout button give card number from dummy website 
and click paynow and click success 
so in mongodb so now it has status as 2
