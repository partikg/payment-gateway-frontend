Adding Items to the Cart (addtocart function):
Purpose: Save selected product data when "Add to Cart" is clicked.
In cartslices files,
in addtocart function you want to save data 
when you click addtocart button it saves data in addtocart function which would be saved in localstorage
the object data we get in addtocart we save all this object in addtocart function but we will only save particular data only like id,title,image,price,discountpercentage,qty 

for this in addtocart function, console log action.payload which would in console when click addtocart button give that products all information from thier take data you want only 
then make a constant cartitems and in that pass id,id,title,image,price,discountpercentage,qty key 
all this data is found in action.payload 
so in each key pass as for id: action.payload.id and qty is 1 as default value
then push cartitems data 
so our data is saved in addtocart function 

To save data in localstorage:
use localstorage.setItems() and pass the key in which we want save data ie cartitems 
the data is saved in array format and to save in addtocart so convert data into string 
so in localstorage.setItems(), pass JSON.stringify() and in this state.cart as data is in cart key in state 
now when we click addtocart button the data gets saved in localstorage
so in console in localstorage we can see a cartitems key with its value 

( not teached completely
also when again clicked on that same products addtocart button it shows another data saved in localstorage 
so for same products data the quatity should be 1 
for this we will use loop to check that cart already has the same data 
if same id data is already in cart then update the quantity 
for this in state.map() function use map() loop 
)




Keeping Cart Data After Page Refresh:
when we have 2 id values in localstorage and refresh the page then cart(0) shows 0 item but in localstorage we have 2 values in cart
to get this 2 values again cart() on website 
for this make a getcartitems callbackfunction to get the values from localstorage  
in that have a constant cart in which use localstorage.getItems('cartitems') as in localstorage in cartitems key value is stored 
but cartitems data is in string so convert it into array so use JSON.parse() and pass all this localstorage.getItems() function in it
const cart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cartitems'));
now return cart variable 

then make a constant getcartvalue and in that pass getcartitems()

then if condition that if getcartvalues length is 0 then 
give blank array to getcartval variable(different variable)
or else ie getcartvalues length is not 0 then 
give getcartvalue to getcartval variable 
and in inititalstate cart key is given getcartval variable
so we have getcartitems function which get the value in localStorage then if the values length is 0 then define value as blank else get the value as same value in localStorage
so now we click addtocart button if gives cart(1) then we refresh page still it shows cart(1)


Now if we have a product in cart page it shows one product 
so if we again clicked on addtocart button showing cart(2) so 2 products in cart page
for this in addtocart function, make a loop of value saved in cart 
so make a data variable in that use state.cart.filter() loop that will filter data which matches condititon so it gives an array of data
then if condition that data length is 0 ie no data is in cart so add data in cart 
for adding data in cart make a constant cartitems in that give id,title,image,price,discountpercentage,qty data 
else that data we are adding is already in cart then make a qty variable and in that pass console.log(data.qty)

error comes so in cartslices file, in if condition give getcartvalue as null ie if (getcartvalue == null)   
and in console clear the localStorage 

so now refresh and clear the localStorage 
then click addtocart button and in cart we see product 
again click on addtocart button so in cart we can see two products
then in cart page, at loop give {value.title} and at product value give {value.qty}
but quantity is default 1 so change it in cartslices page,at else condition make qty variable in that pass data.qty and in this data.qty do  qty + 1 
but it gives some error so lets see remove function now  

then state.cart.push() pass it in the if() condition 


Remove function:
on clicking remove button the product should get removed 
for this in cart page, at remove code give cursor-pointer property
so on remove button we will get the mouse pointer 
then on its onclick function give dispatch(removecart()) function to remove value.id of the product 
then in cartslices page, at removecart function remove all the code inside 
and do console log action.payload so when we click on remove button that cart id we will get in console 
then again use the same filter loop code with only passing 
v.id!=action.payload to get the all data in action.payload except the id 
then save this all data in state.cart 
now if we click on remove button it removes product 
still it didnt get remove from localstorage as it still shows 
cart(1) even if we remove that product 
for removing product from the localStorage also  
use localstorage.setItems() function with passing cartitems and state.cart in it 
now if we click on remove button the product gets removed from localstorage also 


emptycart:
now in cart page,at the shopping code,make it empty cart and give onclick function with dispatch(emptycart()) function 
and in cartslices page, in emptycart function add localStorage.clear() function with passing cartitems in it 
and define state.cart as blank array 
now if we click on emptycart button all products get removed and cart get empty 


plus and minus:
on clicking + button the product get added and 
on clicking - button the product get removed 
for this in cart page, at plus code ie svg code 
give onclick callback function with dispatch(upadatecartqyt())
and in this upadatecartqyt() pass value.id,qty+1
and also import upadatecartqyt() 
also at minus code give onclick callback function with dispatch(upadatecartqyt()) 
and in this upadatecartqyt() pass value.id,qty-1
then in cartslices page,at upadatecartqyt function pass state,action in its paramter 
and also export upadatecartqyt() 
and do console log action.payload 
now when we click plus or minus button in console it gives id 
but we get only one value as we need two values on clicking plus or minus button
