to get [slug],
how to get values after port no.,
designing of 404 page,error page 


Header Section:
from tailwind css website get Header section code 
In components, make new file Headersection.jsx  
and paste the code in this file 
In Home page, pass Headersection component 
so we get the Headersection on Home page 



error page:
when we have error like we give url http://localhost:3000/aboutuss
which gives error message displayed also error title at top  
now we want to change the error message displayed and error title 
for this go to nextjs official site,search for routing fundatmentals
in that we have File Convention paragraph in which we have 
not-found.js and error.js documents 

not-found.js:
to change the design of 404 error message on browser, the 404 error page being the default page of nextjs
for this in app folder, make a new page not-found.js 
get the code from nextjs website in routing fundatmentals 
and paste in our not-found.js file 
so the code will be shown on browser instead of default 404 error page 
Also to get not-found.js page ui, go to tailwind css components and get the code from 404 pages ui 
and paste in our not-found.js File
Now to change the title of error page, 
for this get the export metadata function and change the title 

but if you make onclick function for a button then it wont work
like if we give onclick function on a button and define the function but if we write 'use client' in that page it will give error 

error.js:
when we get error it shows on browser so instead of that error we want a file page to show
for this make an error.js file  
 

Loading.js:
when we go from Aboutus page to Contactus page it takes some time to load in between 
so in this time we want a loading indicator 
for this make a new file as loading.js 
and paste the code from nextjs website in routing fundatmentals in loading.js document 


The website shows error when we are on http://localhost:3000/products/beauty page 
as we cant go to Aboutus or Contactus page 
for this in Header component, in href of aboutus and Contactus give href="/about-us" and href="/Contact-us"


error.js:
In not-found page, we have given scroll function 
comment this part // var scroll = () => { }
which will shown in error(scroll not defined) when we give wrong url 
but as our website is live this nextjs error page should not be shown 
instead another page should show error with something went wrong or please try again later error message
also dont show 404 message as it means page not found but here page is available 

for this make error.js file 
In app folder, make error.js file 
paste the code from nextjs website in routing fundatmentals in error.js document 
now it shows something went wrong 

uncomment the scroll function code in notfound page 
so it shows 404 error page 




Aboutus and Contactus title:
to change the title in Aboutus page and Contactus page  
paste const metadata code in Aboutus page and Contactus page 
give their title and remove 'use client'  
we will use 'use client' when needed in future
so we get the title on Aboutus page and Contactus page 


slug pages title change:
to change the title of slug page  
In products in [slug] page, 
add the const metadata code and remove 'use client' 
so we have slug title changed 


slug value:
In products ,
to get the parameter or slug value like beauty, 
In beauty page,use useParams function to get all the value in url 
so we define a params constant and give useParams() 
also remove export metadata and use 'use client'   
then console this params constant
In console it will give slug:beauty 
then give params.slug in console log 
so In console it will give beauty
then pass it in return function as 
slug:{params.slug}
which will display as params : beauty 

also to get the path value like for beauty is
/products/beauty 
In beauty page,use usePathname function to get all the path value in url 
so we define a path constant and give usePathname() 
and console log path 
In console we get /products/beauty 


Slug title change:
to change the title of slug page with using 'use client'
as we have used useParams and usePathname which needs 'use client' 
but to change title of a page we use export metadata 
and we cant use the 'use client' and export metadata in one file 
for this we make a new file in components ie Products.jsx file
In Products file component paste all the code from slug page 
and remove export metadata code and give Products name in function
then In slug page, have only export metadata and page function 
and remove all import files,'use client',params and path constant
and call Products component 
so our slug title will get changed 




Products listing page:
from tailwindcss website, copy the category filters code 
and paste in Products component file 
In Products component file, our previously made code we have to delete it  
and in this new tailwindcss code,
give function name as Products
also have params and path constant code and import useParams and usePathname
then our Product page is seen on website 


then in tailwindcss website, copy the product list code 
which is the const products code and loop code 
then products will be seen on Products page


Now the number of product will be how many time of api is called   
means the api gives product data in response so the number of time api gives response that much product will be there in Products component page 
we will use dummyjson api 
so go to dummyjson website and copy the api url of get products by a category 
remove the const products 
make a const of products and setproducts of usestate 
then use useEffect function, in that use axios in that paste api url and also we need to pass parameter so give api url in backticks
and after api url pass parameter of category which we get in website url ie {params.slug} which is like beauty category 
and then function for success of api 
in which use setproducts to give api response and pass success.data.products 
as our dummyjson api has products key in which we have all data 
and catch function for api error 
after that in our product loop code, we will give key names according to dummyjson api 
so changes will be for 
    product.alt we give product.title ,
    product.imageSrc give product.thumbnail,
    product.href give product.title,
    product.name give product.title,
    product.color give product.brand 
So in website we get 5 products with image,name,price,brand
Also when we change category our products will also get changed
